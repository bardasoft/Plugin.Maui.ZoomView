## Getting Started
## Bindable Properties

The `ZoomView` control exposes the following bindable properties:

| Property              | Type    | Default | Description |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `Content`             | `View`  | `null`  | The content to be displayed inside the zoomable area. |
| `ZoomInOnDoubleTap`   | `bool`  | `true`  | If `true`, a double-tap will zoom in when the zoom level is at default. |
| `ZoomOutOnDoubleTap`  | `bool`  | `true`  | If `true`, a double-tap will reset zoom when already zoomed in. |





### Installation
1. Add the `Plugin.Maui.ZoomView` package to your .NET MAUI project. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package Plugin.Maui.ZoomView
   ```

2. Ensure your project is set up for .NET MAUI and includes the necessary platform-specific configurations.

3. After installing the package, call the `UseZoomView()` method in the `MauiProgram.cs` file of your project to initialize the plugin:
   ```csharp
   public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
   {
       var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
       builder
           .UseMauiApp<App>()
           .UseZoomView(); // Add this line

       return builder.Build();
   }
   ```

## Usage

1. Add the `ZoomView` control to your XAML file:
   ```xml
   <ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
                xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
                xmlns:zoomview="clr-namespace:Plugin.Maui.ZoomView;assembly=Plugin.Maui.ZoomView"
                x:Class="YourNamespace.MainPage">
       <zoomview:ZoomView>
           <!-- Add your content here -->
       </zoomview:ZoomView>
   </ContentPage>
   ```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> `ZoomView` is best suited for non-interactive content like `Image`, `Label`, or static custom views. While interactive controls (e.g., `Entry`, `Editor`, `Button`) can be placed inside, they may not behave reliably during zoom or pan. Use with caution.
